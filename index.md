I am a sixth-year Ph.D. student in mathematics at <a href="https://math.yale.edu/">Yale University</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://annacgilbert.github.io/">Prof. Anna C. Gilbert</a>. I am currently on the job market.

My research interest includes algorithms on metric embedding in particular on tree metrics, geometric characteristics on random graph models, and problems with application to graph datasets.
