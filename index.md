I am a sixth-year Ph.D. student in mathematics at Yale University under the supervision of Prof. Anna C. Gilbert.

My research interest includes algorithms on metric embedding in particular on tree metrics, geometric characteristics on random graph models, and their applications on such as real-world massive dataset.
